### I. Video Stabilization OpenVX
Simple video stabilization based on Harris Corners detection and Lucas-Kanade optical flow
* The core of the graph is the Detection and Tracking block, which consumes gray-scale image (“Grayscale”) and produces a transform matrix (“Matrix”). The process of conversion of the input RGB image to NV12 image followed by extraction of the Y (luminance) channel obtain the grayscale image.

* The Detection and Tracking block uses a combination of the Harris Corners detector and the Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow method to recognize global movements between two neighbor frames in a video stream. Kalman filter filters the sequence of the local transformations between neighbor frames to obtain final stabilization transformation matrix for the current frame. At each iteration, the Harris Corners node detects points for using at the next iteration. The Optical Flow node estimates new positions for points detected at the previous iteration.

### II. [Vx_delay](https://software.intel.com/en-us/sample-video-stabilization-using-vx-delay-to-implement-a-loop-dependency-in-the-graph)
A delay is an opaque object that contains a manually-controlled list of objects, which is stored in a ring buffer.Each element in the delay is accessed by an index and can be passed as a node parameter in a graph.
