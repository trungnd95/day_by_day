## **Computer vision a-z**
### I. Image Basic 
  - **What is pixel?** 
    * Every image consists of a set of pixels. Pixels are the raw, building blocks of an image.If we think of an image as a grid, each square in the grid contains a single pixel.
    **_For example_** : Image resolution 500 x 300. This means that our image is         represented as a grid of pixels, with 500 rows and 300 columns.Overall, there are 500 x 300 = 150, 000 pixels in our image.
    * Most pixels are represented in two ways: grayscale and color. In a grayscale image, each pixel has a value between 0 and 255, where zero is corresponds to “black” and 255 being “white”. Color pixels are normally represented in the RGB color space –one value for the Red component, one for Green, and one for Blue.
    * OpenCV stores RGB channels in _reverse order_ -> **(B, G, R)**
 - **Coordinate system**
 - **Accessing and change value of pixel**

### II. Drawing
### III. Image Processing
**1. Image transformation** : including translation, rotation, resizing, flipping and cropping
- **_Translation :_** 
    * Translation is the shifting of an image along the x and y axis. Using translation, we can shift an image up, down,left, or right, along with any combination of the above!
    * Using a translation matrix supported by openCV. M[[1, 0, tx][1, 0, ty]] The first row of the matrix. Then, we define the second row of the matrix as [0, 1, ty], where ty is the number of pixels we will shift the image up or down. Negative valuee of ty will shift the image up and positive values will shift the image down is [1, 0, tx], where tx is the number of pixels we will shift the image left or right. Negative values of tx will shift the image to the left and positive values will shift the image to the right.
    * Actual translation takes place in **warpAffine** function supported by OpenCV
- Rotation
- Resizing 
- Flipping ( Lật ảnh )
    We can flip an image around either the x or y axis, or even both.
- Cropping
 

**2. Image Arithmetic**
**3. Bitwise Operation** : AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.
**4. Masking**
**5. Splitting and merging channels**
### VI. Histograms
Definition: _A histogram represents the distribution of pixel intensities (whether color or grayscale) in an image._
**1. Using OpenCV to compute histogram**
**2.Grayscale Histograms**
**3.Color Histograms**
**4. Histogram Equalization**
* Histogram equalization improves the contrast of an image
by “stretching” the distribution of pixels.
* Histogram equalization is applied to grayscale
images.
* Applying histogram equalization to a photograph, a satellite image, or an X-ray

### V. Smoothing and blurring
**1. Average**
**2. Gaussian**
**3. Median**
**4. Bilateral**
* The intention of our blurring methods have been to reduce noise and detail in an image; however, we tend to lose edges in the image. In order to reduce noise while still maintaining edges, we can use bilateral blurring.
* Bilateral blurring accomplishes this by introducing two Gaussian distributions

### VI. Thresholding
* Thresholding is the binarization of an image. In general, we seek to convert a grayscale image to a binary image, where the pixels are either 0 or 255.
* Normally, we use thresholding to focus on objects or areas of particular interest in an image. In the examples in the sections below, we will empty out our pockets and look at our spare change. Using thresholding methods, we’ll be able to find the coins in an image.

### VII. Gradients and edge detection
### VIII. Contours
