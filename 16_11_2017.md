Today I gained somethings, 
### C++ smart pointer and raw pointer
### C++ pointer 
Somethings need to remember with : 
1. Pointers are variables that hold memory addresses. As a program is executing, all variables are stored in memory, each at its own unique address or location. **A pointer is a special type of variable that contains a memory address rather than a data value.** Just as data is modified when a normal variable is used, the value of the address stored in a pointer is modified as a pointer variable is manipulated. Example: 
``` C++
int *intptr; // Declare a pointer that holds the address
             // of a memory location that can store an integer.
             // Note the use of * to indicate this is a pointer variable.

intptr = new int; // Allocate memory for the integer.
*intptr = 5; // Store 5 in the memory address stored in intptr.
```
2. We usually say that a pointer "points" to the location it is storing

Notice the use of the "new" operator to allocate memory for our integer pointee. This is something we must do before trying to access the pointee.
```Javascript
int *ptr; // Declare integer pointer.
ptr = new int; // Allocate some memory for the integer.
*ptr = 5; // Dereference to initialize the pointee.
*ptr = *ptr + 1; // We are dereferencing ptr in order
                 // to add one to the value stored
                 // at the ptr address.
```
The * operator is used for dereferencing in C. One of the most common errors C/C++ programmers make in working with pointers is forgetting to initialize the pointee.**This can sometimes cause a runtime crash because we are accessing a location in memory that contains unknown data. If we try and modify this data, we can cause subtle memory corruption making it a hard bug to track down.** 
3. Pointer assignment between two pointers makes them point to the same pointee. So the assignment y = x; makes y point to the same pointee as x. Pointer assignment does not touch the pointee. It just changes one pointer to have the same location as another pointer. After pointer assignment, the two pointers "share" the pointee.
